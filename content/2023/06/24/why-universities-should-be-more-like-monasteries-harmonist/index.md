_By Dr. Molly Worthen, a historian at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who writes frequently about higher education. Originally published by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/opinion/college-students-monks-mental-health-smart-phones.html).  

作者：莫莉·沃森 (Molly Worthen) 博士，她是北卡罗来纳大学教堂山分校的历史学家，经常撰写有关高等教育的文章。最初由《纽约时报》发表。_

Students are hungry for a low-tech, introspective experience — and not just students in the Ivy League. [Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fnMY_tSYM6bMVn2w3zvCDzLNPq_lXt4_/view) suggests that underprivileged young people have far fewer opportunities to think for unbroken stretches of time, so they may need even more space in college to develop what social scientists call cognitive endurance.  

学生们渴望一种低技术含量、内省的体验——而不仅仅是常春藤盟校的学生。研究表明，贫困年轻人不间断思考的机会要少得多，因此他们可能需要在大学里有更多的空间来培养社会科学家所说的认知耐力。

Yet the most visible higher ed trends are moving in the other direction. Rather than ban phones and laptops from class, some professors are [brainstorming](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/07/22/snapchat-instagram-and-other-unexpected-guests-college-classroom-opinion) ways to embrace students’ tech addictions with class Facebook and Instagram accounts, audience response apps — and perhaps even including the friends and relatives whom students text during class as virtual participants in class discussion.  

然而，最明显的高等教育趋势正在朝另一个方向发展。一些教授并没有禁止在课堂上使用手机和笔记本电脑，而是集思广益，通过课堂 Facebook 和 Instagram 帐户、观众反馈应用程序来解决学生对科技的沉迷，甚至可能让学生在课堂上发短信的朋友和亲戚作为课堂讨论的虚拟参与者。 。

Then there’s that other unwelcome classroom visitor: artificial intelligence. A [survey](https://www.intelligent.com/nearly-1-in-3-college-students-have-used-chatgpt-on-written-assignments/) of 1,000 college students by the college-ranking website Intelligent found that 30 percent of respondents had already [used ChatGPT](https://www.chronicle.com/article/im-a-student-you-have-no-idea-how-much-were-using-chatgpt) to complete a written assignment. Some campus experts on teaching encourage faculty members to stop worrying and love the bot by designing assignments that “help students develop their prompting skills” or “use ChatGPT to generate a first draft,” according to a [tip sheet](https://ctl.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-ChatGPT-in-Assignments.pdf) produced by the Center for Teaching and Learning at Washington University in St. Louis.  

还有另一个不受欢迎的课堂访客：人工智能。大学排名网站Intelligent对1000名大学生进行的一项调查发现，30%的受访者已经使用ChatGPT来完成书面作业。根据教学中心制作的一份提示表，一些校园教学专家通过设计“帮助学生发展提示技能”或“使用 ChatGPT 生成初稿”的作业，鼓励教职员工停止担心并喜欢机器人。在圣路易斯华盛顿大学学习。

It’s [not at all clear](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/inside-the-heart-of-chatgpts-darkness) that we want a future dominated by A.I.’s amoral, Cheez Whiz version of human thought. It is abundantly clear that texting, tagging and chatbotting are making students miserable right now. One recent national [survey](https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/mental-health-crisis-college-campuses) found that 60 percent of American college students reported the symptoms of at least one mental health problem and that 15 percent said they were considering suicide. A recent [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36942345/) of 36 studies of college students’ mental health found a significant correlation between longer screen time and higher risk of anxiety and depression. And while social media can [sometimes](https://mental.jmir.org/2021/7/e24512) help suffering students connect with peers, research on [teenagers](https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/social-medias-impact-students-mental-health-comes-focus) and [college students](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20211218) suggests that overall, the support of a virtual community cannot compensate for the vortex of gossip, bullying and Instagram posturing that is bound to rot any normal person’s self-esteem.  

目前还不清楚我们是否想要一个由人工智能的不道德的、Cheez Whiz 版本的人类思想主导的未来。很明显，短信、标签和聊天机器人现在让学生们感到痛苦。最近的一项全国调查发现，60% 的美国大学生报告至少存在一种心理健康问题的症状，15% 的人表示他们正在考虑自杀。最近对 36 项大学生心理健康研究进行的荟萃分析发现，较长的屏幕时间与较高的焦虑和抑郁风险之间存在显着相关性。虽然社交媒体有时可以帮助遭受苦难的学生与同龄人建立联系，但对青少年和大学生的研究表明，总体而言，虚拟社区的支持无法弥补八卦、欺凌和 Instagram 姿态的漩涡，这些漩涡势必会腐蚀任何正常人的自我-尊重。

We need an intervention: maybe not a vow of silence but a bold move to put the screens, the pinging notifications and the creepy humanoid A.I. chatbots in their proper place. They are our tools, not our masters. That doesn’t mean a futile attempt to wall off higher education from the modern world; it does mean selectively returning to the university’s roots in the monastic schools of medieval Europe and rekindling the old-fashioned quest for meaning.  

我们需要干预：也许不是发誓保持沉默，而是采取大胆的举措，将屏幕、ping通知和令人毛骨悚然的人形人工智能。聊天机器人在适当的位置。他们是我们的工具，而不是我们的主人。这并不意味着将高等教育与现代世界隔离开来的尝试是徒劳的。它确实意味着有选择地回归大学在中世纪欧洲修道院学校的根源，并重新点燃对意义的老式追求。

Colleges should offer a radically low-tech first-year program for students who want to apply: a secular monastery within the modern university, with a curated set of courses that ban glowing rectangles of any kind from the classroom. Students could opt to live in dorms that restrict technology, too. We can work individually with students who have accessibility accommodations to find the best low-tech solutions for them (like turning off Wi-Fi, rationing screen time and deleting attention-guzzling apps).  

大学应该为想要申请的学生提供技术含量极低的第一年课程：现代大学内的世俗修道院，提供一套精心设计的课程，禁止在课堂上出现任何类型的发光矩形。学生也可以选择住在限制技术的宿舍里。我们可以与拥有无障碍设施的学生单独合作，为他们找到最佳的低技术解决方案（例如关闭 Wi-Fi、分配屏幕时间和删除耗用注意力的应用程序）。

I prophesy that universities that do this will be surprised by how much demand there is. I frequently talk to students who resent the distracting laptops all around them during class. They feel the tug of the “imaginary string attaching me to my phone, where I have to constantly check it,” as Ms. Rodriguez, who took the monk class and Existential Despair, put it. Many, if not most, students want the elusive experience of uninterrupted thought, the kind where a hash of half-baked notions slowly becomes an idea about the world.  

我预言这样做的大学将会对需求量之大感到惊讶。我经常与那些讨厌课堂上周围分散注意力的笔记本电脑的学生交谈。正如参加过僧侣课程和“存在绝望”课程的罗德里格斯女士所说，他们感受到了“一根想象中的绳子将我与手机相连，我必须不断地检查手机”。许多（如果不是大多数）学生想要不间断思考的难以捉摸的体验，在这种体验中，一堆半生不熟的概念慢慢变成了关于世界的想法。

Even if your goal is effective use of the latest chatbot, it behooves you to read books in hard copies and read enough of them to learn what an elegant paragraph sounds like. How else will students recognize when ChatGPT churns out decent prose instead of bureaucratic drivel?  

即使您的目标是有效使用最新的聊天机器人，您也应该阅读纸质书籍并阅读足够的内容以了解优雅的段落听起来是什么样的。当 ChatGPT 写出像样的散文而不是官僚的胡言乱语时，学生们还能如何认识到呢？

Most important, students need head space to think about their ultimate values. Contemplation and marathon reading are not ends in themselves or mere vacations from real life but are among the best ways to figure out your own answer to the question of what a human being is for — a question that is all the more pressing at a time when the robots soon may be coming for the white-collar jobs in [medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9955430/), [law](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/technology/ai-is-coming-for-lawyers-again.html) and [finance](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-legal-finance-jobs-construction-trade-careers-tech-2023-3) that the secular intelligentsia treats as shorthand for personal fulfillment. To use the trendy pedagogical jargon, here are the student learning outcomes universities should focus on: cognitive endurance and existential clarity.  

最重要的是，学生需要头脑空间来思考他们的最终价值观。沉思和马拉松式的阅读本身并不是目的，也不仅仅是现实生活中的度假，而是找出自己对“人的目的是什么”这个问题的答案的最佳方式之一——这个问题在当今时代显得更加紧迫。机器人可能很快就会出现在医学、法律和金融领域的白领工作中，世俗知识分子将这些工作视为个人成就感的捷径。用流行的教学术语来说，大学应该关注学生的学习成果：认知耐力和存在清晰度。

Colleges could do all this in classes integrated with general education requirements: ideally, a sequence of [great books](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/opinion/sunday/can-i-go-to-great-books-camp.html) seminars focused on classic texts from across different civilizations. When students finish, they can move right into their area of specialization and wire up their skulls with all the technology they want, armed with the habits and perspective to do so responsibly. Risk-averse college presidents and deans, I’m looking at you: If you can’t quite see starting this as a full-year program, try piloting it as summer school or a winter-break technology detox course.  

大学可以在与通识教育要求相结合的课堂上完成这一切：理想情况下，一系列精彩的书籍研讨会重点关注来自不同文明的经典文本。当学生完成后，他们可以直接进入他们的专业领域，用他们想要的所有技术连接他们的头骨，并养成负责任地这样做的习惯和观点。规避风险的大学校长和院长们，我在看着你们：如果你们不能完全理解将其作为一个全年计划开始，请尝试将其作为暑期学校或寒假技术排毒课程进行试点。

But before we domesticate the monastic impulse, it’s worth learning from the radicals. Dr. McDaniel, the religious studies professor at Penn, has a long history with different monastic traditions. He grew up in Philadelphia, educated by Hungarian Catholic monks. After college, he volunteered in Thailand and Laos and lived as a Buddhist monk.  

但在我们驯化修道院冲动之前，值得向激进分子学习。宾夕法尼亚大学宗教研究教授麦克丹尼尔博士与不同的修道院传统有着悠久的历史。他在费城长大，接受匈牙利天主教僧侣的教育。大学毕业后，他在泰国和老挝做志愿者，并以佛教僧侣的身份生活。

As his teaching career took him from Ohio University to the University of California, Riverside, and then to Penn, he found that no amount of academic reading could help undergraduates truly understand why “people voluntarily take on celibacy, give up drinking and put themselves under authorities they don’t need to,” he told me. So for 20 years, he has helped students try it out — and question some of their assumptions about what it means to find themselves.  

在他的教学生涯中，他从俄亥俄大学到加州大学河滨分校，再到宾夕法尼亚大学，他发现再多的学术阅读也无法帮助本科生真正理解为什么“人们自愿独身、戒酒、将自己置于他们不需要当局，”他告诉我。因此，20 年来，他一直帮助学生进行尝试，并质疑他们关于寻找自我意味着什么的一些假设。

“On college campuses, these students think they’re all being individuals, going out and being wild,” he said. “But they’re in a playpen. I tell them, ‘You know you’ll be protected by campus police and lawyers. You have this entire apparatus set up for you. You think you’re being an individual, but look at your four friends: They all look exactly like you and sound like you. We exist in these very strict structures we like to pretend don’t exist.’” (It’s worth mentioning that Dr. McDaniel describes his politics as “philosophical anarchist.”) His course offers a chance to temporarily exchange those unconscious structures for a set of deliberate, countercultural ones.  

“在大学校园里，这些学生认为他们都是独立的个体，走出去，狂野起来，”他说。 “但他们在婴儿围栏里。我告诉他们，‘你们知道你们会受到校园警察和律师的保护。整个装置已经为您准备好了。你认为你是一个独立的个体，但看看你的四个朋友：他们看起来都和你一模一样，听起来也和你一模一样。我们存在于这些非常严格的结构中，我们喜欢假装不存在。”（值得一提的是，麦克丹尼尔博士把他的政治描述为“哲学无政府主义者”。）他的课程提供了一个机会，可以暂时将这些无意识的结构交换为一套故意的、反文化的。

No one understands discipline better than the [Benedictines,](https://osb.org/our-roots/a-brief-history-of-the-benedictine-order/) members of the monastic order who follow the rule written by St. Benedict in the sixth century. Undergraduates at Belmont Abbey College outside Charlotte, N.C., share their quadrangles, sidewalks and even their chess clubs with Benedictine monks who live in an abbey in the middle of campus. “For the last 1,500 years, Benedictines have had to deal with technology,” Placid Solari, the abbot there, told me. “For us, the question is: How do you use the tool so it supports and enhances your purpose or mission and you don’t get owned by it?”  

没有人比本笃会更了解纪律，他们是修道院成员，遵循圣本笃在六世纪制定的规则。北卡罗来纳州夏洛特郊外的贝尔蒙特修道院学院的本科生与住在校园中央修道院的本笃会僧侣共享他们的四合院、人行道，甚至国际象棋俱乐部。 “在过去的 1,500 年里，本笃会不得不与技术打交道，”那里的修道院院长普莱西德·索拉里 (Placid Solari) 告诉我。 “对我们来说，问题是：如何使用该工具，使其支持和增强您的目的或使命，同时又不被它所左右？”

Mental distraction was a struggle even for the ancient ascetics who didn’t have Snapchat. When the mind wanders and a monk wants “to bind it fast with the firmest purpose of heart, as if with chains, while we are making the attempt, it slips away from the inmost recesses of the heart swifter than a snake,” John Cassian, a fourth-century monk, wrote. Many monasteries don’t totally reject the latest technology, but they are mindful of how they use it. Abbot Placid told me that for novices at his monastery, “part of the formation is discipline to learn how to control technology use.” After this initial time of limited phone and TV “to wean them away from overdependence on technology and its stimulation,” they get more access and mostly make their own choices.  

即使对于没有 Snapchat 的古代苦行僧来说，分散注意力也是一场斗争。约翰·卡西安（John Cassian）说，当心灵游离时，修道士想要“用内心最坚定的目标将其牢牢束缚，就像用锁链一样，当我们尝试时，它会比蛇更快地从内心最深处溜走”。一位四世纪的僧侣写道。许多修道院并不完全拒绝最新技术，但他们很注意如何使用它。住持普拉西德告诉我，对于他修道院的新手来说，“训练的一部分是学习如何控制技术使用的纪律。”在最初使用有限的电话和电视“让他们摆脱对技术及其刺激的过度依赖”之后，他们获得了更多的机会，并且大多做出自己的选择。

Evan Lutz graduated this May from Belmont Abbey with a major in theology. He stressed the special Catholic context of Belmont’s resident monks; if you experiment with monastic practices without investigating the whole worldview, it can become a shallow kind of mindfulness tourism. The monks at Belmont Abbey do more than model contemplation and focus. Their presence compels even non-Christians on campus to think seriously about vocation and the meaning of life. “Either what the monks are doing is valuable and based on something true, or it’s completely ridiculous,” Mr. Lutz said. “In both cases, there’s something striking there, and it asks people a question.”  

埃文·卢茨今年五月从贝尔蒙特修道院毕业，主修神学。他强调了贝尔蒙特常驻僧侣的特殊天主教背景；如果你在没有调查整个世界观的情况下尝试寺院实践，它可能会成为一种肤浅的正念旅游。贝尔蒙特修道院的僧侣们所做的不仅仅是模范沉思和集中注意力。他们的存在甚至迫使校园里的非基督徒认真思考职业和生命的意义。 “僧侣们所做的要么是有价值的、基于真实的事情，要么就是完全荒谬的，”卢茨先生说。 “在这两种情况下，都有一些引人注目的东西，它向人们提出了一个问题。”

Pondering ultimate questions and cultivating cognitive endurance should not be luxury goods.  

思考终极问题、培养认知耐力不应该是奢侈品。
