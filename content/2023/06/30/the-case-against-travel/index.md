What is the most uninformative statement that people are inclined to make? My nominee would be “I love to travel.” This tells you very little about a person, because nearly everyone likes to travel; and yet people say it, because, for some reason, they pride themselves both on having travelled and on the fact that they look forward to doing so.  

人们最常说的最无信息的说法是什么？我的提名是“我喜欢旅行”。这只能告诉你很少关于一个人的信息，因为几乎每个人都喜欢旅行；然而人们之所以这么说，是因为出于某种原因，他们为自己旅行过并期待这样做而感到自豪。

The opposition team is small but articulate. [G. K. Chesterton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/07/07/the-back-of-the-world) wrote that “travel narrows the mind.” [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ralph-waldo-emerson) called travel “a fool’s paradise.” Socrates and Immanuel Kant—arguably the two greatest philosophers of all time—voted with their feet, rarely leaving their respective home towns of Athens and Königsberg. But the greatest hater of travel, ever, was the Portuguese writer [Fernando Pessoa](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/fernando-pessoas-disappearing-act), whose wonderful “[Book of Disquiet](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Disquiet-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141183047?ots=1&slotNum=3&imprToken=fec48658-2b20-ac0a-370&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50)” crackles with outrage:  

反对派队伍虽小，但善于表达。 G.K.切斯特顿（G.K.Chesterton）写道，“旅行可以开阔视野”。拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生将旅行称为“傻瓜的天堂”。苏格拉底和伊曼努尔·康德——可以说是有史以来最伟大的两位哲学家——用脚投票，很少离开各自的家乡雅典和柯尼斯堡。但有史以来最讨厌旅行的是葡萄牙作家费尔南多·佩索阿，他精彩的《不安之书》中充满了愤怒：

I abhor new ways of life and unfamiliar places. . . . The idea of travelling nauseates me. . . . Ah, let those who don’t exist travel! . . . Travel is for those who cannot feel. . . . Only extreme poverty of the imagination justifies having to move around to feel.  

我讨厌新的生活方式和陌生的地方。 。 。 。旅行的想法让我感到恶心。 。 。 。啊，让那些不存在的人去旅行吧！ 。 。 。旅行是为那些没有感觉的人准备的。 。 。 。只有想象力极度匮乏才需要四处走动去感受。

If you are inclined to dismiss this as contrarian posturing, try shifting the object of your thought from your own travel to that of others. At home or abroad, one tends to avoid “touristy” activities. “Tourism” is what we call travelling when other people are doing it. And, although people like to talk about their travels, few of us like to listen to them. Such talk resembles academic writing and reports of dreams: forms of communication driven more by the needs of the producer than the consumer.  

如果您倾向于认为这是逆势姿态，请尝试将您的思考对象从您自己的旅行转移到其他人的旅行。在国内或国外，人们往往会避免“旅游”活动。 “旅游”就是我们所说的当其他人在做的时候旅行。而且，尽管人们喜欢谈论他们的旅行，但我们很少有人喜欢听他们说话。这样的谈话类似于学术写作和梦想报告：更多地由生产者而不是消费者的需求驱动的交流形式。

One common argument for travel is that it lifts us into an enlightened state, educating us about the world and connecting us to its denizens. Even [Samuel Johnson](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/08/man-of-fetters), a skeptic—“What I gained by being in France was, learning to be better satisfied with my own country,” he once said—conceded that travel had a certain cachet. Advising his beloved Boswell, Johnson recommended a trip to China, for the sake of Boswell’s children: “There would be a lustre reflected upon them. . . . They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China.”  

关于旅行的一个常见论点是，它让我们进入一种开明的状态，让我们了解世界，并将我们与世界上的居民联系起来。即使是怀疑论者塞缪尔·约翰逊（Samuel Johnson）也承认旅行有一定的威望——“我在法国的收获是，学会了对自己的国家更加满意”。约翰逊在向他心爱的博斯韦尔提出建议时，建议为了博斯韦尔的孩子们去中国旅行：“他们身上会折射出光彩。 。 。 。他们在任何时候都会被视为一个去过中国长城的人的孩子。”

Travel gets branded as an achievement: see interesting places, have interesting experiences, become interesting people. Is that what it really is?  

旅行被视为一种成就：看到有趣的地方，拥有有趣的经历，成为有趣的人。真的是这样吗？

Pessoa, Emerson, and Chesterton believed that travel, far from putting us in touch with humanity, divorced us from it. Travel turns us into the worst version of ourselves while convincing us that we’re at our best. Call this the traveller’s delusion.  

佩索阿、爱默生和切斯特顿认为，旅行非但没有让我们接触人性，反而使我们与人性分离。旅行把我们变成最糟糕的自己，同时让我们相信自己处于最好的状态。这就是旅行者的错觉。

To explore it, let’s start with what we mean by “travel.” Socrates went abroad when he was called to fight in the Peloponnesian War; even so, he was no traveller. Emerson is explicit about steering his critique away from a person who travels when his “necessities” or “duties” demand it. He has no objection to traversing great distances “for the purpose of art, of study, and benevolence.” One sign that you have a reason to be somewhere is that you have nothing to prove, and therefore no drive to collect souvenirs, photos, or stories to prove it. Let’s define “tourism” as the kind of travel that aims at the interesting—and, if Emerson and company are right, misses.  

为了探索它，让我们从“旅行”的含义开始。苏格拉底因参加伯罗奔尼撒战争而出国。即便如此，他也不是旅行者。爱默生明确表示，他不会批评那些因“必需品”或“职责”而旅行的人。他不反对“为了艺术、学习和仁慈”长途跋涉。表明你有理由去某个地方的一个迹象是，你没有什么可以证明的，因此没有动力去收集纪念品、照片或故事来证明这一点。让我们将“旅游”定义为一种以有趣的旅行为目标的旅行，如果艾默生和他的公司是对的话，那么这种旅行就是为了错过。

“A tourist is a temporarily leisured person who voluntarily visits a place away from home for the purpose of experiencing a change.” This definition is taken from the opening of “[Hosts and Guests](https://www.amazon.com/Hosts-Guests-Anthropology-Valene-Smith/dp/0812212800?ots=1&slotNum=4&imprToken=fec48658-2b20-ac0a-370&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),” the classic academic volume on the anthropology of tourism. The last phrase is crucial: touristic travel exists for the sake of change. But what, exactly, gets changed? Here is a telling observation from the concluding chapter of the same book: “Tourists are less likely to borrow from their hosts than their hosts are from them, thus precipitating a chain of change in the host community.” We go to experience a change, but end up inflicting change on others.  

“游客是暂时闲暇的人，自愿到远离家乡的地方去体验变化。”这个定义取自旅游人类学经典学术著作《主与客》的开篇。最后一句话至关重要：旅游是为了改变而存在的。但到底改变了什么？同一本书的最后一章有一个生动的观察：“游客向东道主借钱的可能性要小于东道主向东道主借钱的可能性，从而引发了东道主社区的一系列变化。”我们去经历改变，但最终却给别人带来了改变。

For example, a decade ago, when I was in Abu Dhabi, I went on a guided tour of a falcon hospital. I took a photo with a falcon on my arm. I have no interest in falconry or falcons, and a generalized dislike of encounters with nonhuman animals. But the falcon hospital was one of the answers to the question, “What does one do in Abu Dhabi?” So I went. I suspect that everything about the falcon hospital, from its layout to its mission statement, is and will continue to be shaped by the visits of people like me—we unchanged changers, we tourists. (On the wall of the foyer, I recall seeing a series of “excellence in tourism” awards. Keep in mind that this is an animal hospital.)  

例如，十年前，当我在阿布扎比时，我在导游的带领下参观了一家猎鹰医院。我拍了一张手臂上有一只猎鹰的照片。我对猎鹰或猎鹰不感兴趣，并且普遍不喜欢与非人类动物相遇。但猎鹰医院是这个问题的答案之一：“人们在阿布扎比做什么？”所以我去了。我怀疑猎鹰医院的一切，从它的布局到它的使命宣言，都将继续受到像我这样的人的访问的影响——我们是不变的改变者，我们是游客。 （在门厅的墙上，我记得看到了一系列“旅游卓越奖”。请记住，这是一家动物医院。）

Why might it be bad for a place to be shaped by the people who travel there, voluntarily, for the purpose of experiencing a change? The answer is that such people not only do not know what they are doing but are not even trying to learn. Consider me. It would be one thing to have such a deep passion for falconry that one is willing to fly to Abu Dhabi to pursue it, and it would be another thing to approach the visit in an aspirational spirit, with the hope of developing my life in a new direction. I was in neither position. I entered the hospital knowing that my post-Abu Dhabi life would contain exactly as much falconry as my pre-Abu Dhabi life—which is to say, zero falconry. If you are going to see something you neither value nor aspire to value, you are not doing much of anything besides locomoting.  

为什么一个地方由那些为了体验变化而自愿前往那里的人们来塑造可能是件坏事？答案是，这些人不仅不知道自己在做什么，而且根本不去尝试学习。考虑我。对猎鹰运动怀有如此深厚的热情，以至于愿意飞往阿布扎比去追求它是一回事，而以一种雄心勃勃的精神来进行这次访问，希望以一种更美好的方式发展我的生活，则是另一回事。新方向。我不属于这两种情况。当我进入医院时，我知道我离开阿布扎比后的生活将包含与我离开阿布扎比之前一样多的猎鹰——也就是说，零猎鹰。如果你要看到一些你既不重视也不渴望重视的东西，那么除了移动之外，你什么也没做。

Tourism is marked by its locomotive character. “I _went_ to France.” O.K., but what did you do there? “I _went_ to the Louvre.” O.K., but what did you do there? “I _went_ to see the ‘Mona Lisa.’ ” That is, before quickly moving on: apparently, many people spend just fifteen seconds looking at the “Mona Lisa.” It’s locomotion all the way down.  

旅游业具有火车头的特点。 “我去法国了。”好吧，但是你在那里做了什么？ “我去了卢浮宫。”好吧，但是你在那里做了什么？ “我去看了《蒙娜丽莎》。”这就是说，然后快速继续：显然，很多人只花了十五秒钟看《蒙娜丽莎》。这是一路向下的运动。

The peculiar rationality of tourists allows them to be moved both by a desire to do what they are supposed to do in a place and a desire to avoid precisely what they are supposed to do. This is how it came to pass that, on my first trip to Paris, I avoided both the “Mona Lisa” and the Louvre. I did not, however, avoid locomotion. I walked from one end of the city to the other, over and over again, in a straight line; if you plotted my walks on a map, they would have formed a giant asterisk. In the many great cities I have actually lived and worked in, I would never consider spending whole days walking. When you travel, you suspend your usual standards for what counts as a valuable use of time. You suspend other standards as well, unwilling to be constrained by your taste in food, art, or recreational activities. After all, you say to yourself, the whole point of travelling is to break out of the confines of everyday life. But, if you usually avoid museums, and suddenly seek them out for the purpose of experiencing a change, what are you going to make of the paintings? You might as well be in a room full of falcons.  

游客独特的理性使他们既希望在某个地方做他们应该做的事情，又希望避免他们应该做的事情。就这样，我第一次去巴黎时，既避开了《蒙娜丽莎》，也避开了卢浮宫。然而，我并没有避免移动。我从城市的一端走到另一端，一遍又一遍，笔直地走着；如果你把我走过的路画在地图上，它们会形成一个巨大的星号。在我实际生活和工作过的许多大城市中，我绝不会考虑花一整天的时间步行。当您旅行时，您会暂时搁置对时间的宝贵利用的通常标准。你也悬置其他标准，不愿意受到你对食物、艺术或娱乐活动的品味的限制。毕竟，你对自己说，旅行的全部意义就是冲破日常生活的束缚。但是，如果你平时避开博物馆，突然为了体验改变而去博物馆，你会对这些画作有何看法？你还不如待在一个满是猎鹰的房间里。

Let’s delve a bit deeper into how, exactly, the tourist’s project is self-undermining. I’ll illustrate with two examples from “The Loss of the Creature,” an essay by the writer Walker Percy.  

让我们更深入地研究一下，游客的项目到底是如何自我破坏的。我将用作家沃克·珀西的文章《生物的消失》中的两个例子来说明。

First, a sightseer arriving at the Grand Canyon. Before his trip, an idea of the canyon—a “symbolic complex”—had formed in his mind. He is delighted if the canyon resembles the pictures and postcards he has seen; he might even describe it as “every bit as beautiful as a picture postcard!” But, if the lighting is different, the colors and shadows not those which he expects, he feels cheated: he has arrived on a bad day. Unable to gaze directly at the canyon, forced to judge merely whether it matches an image, the sightseer “may simply be bored; or he may be conscious of the difficulty: that the great thing yawning at his feet somehow eludes him.”  

首先，游客到达大峡谷。在旅行之前，他脑海中就已经形成了峡谷的概念——一个“象征性的综合体”。如果峡谷与他所见过的图片和明信片相似，他会很高兴；他甚至可能形容它“就像一张明信片一样美丽！”但是，如果光线不同，颜色和阴影不是他所期望的，他就会感觉被欺骗了：他在糟糕的一天到达了。由于无法直视峡谷，只能判断它是否与图像相符，观光者“可能只是感到无聊；或者他可能意识到了困难：在他脚下打哈欠的伟大事物不知何故躲开了他。
