In retrospect, it was the beginning of the end. One night in 2010, Benjamin Schulz was working late in his "grimy, depressing" grad student office when he turned his attention to the latest news on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. While "staring morbidly at the oil billowing out of the undersea pipe," something inside Schulz snapped, causing him to question his professional path. "Look at how messed up everything in the world is," Schulz—who was in his second year of a computer science Ph.D. at the University of Missouri in Columbia at the time—recalls thinking. "What am I doing sitting here trying really hard to work out this elaborate formal calculus that just says that one wire is not connected to a different wire?"  

回想起来，那是结束的开始。 2010 年的一个晚上，本杰明·舒尔茨 (Benjamin Schulz) 在他的“肮脏、压抑”的研究生办公室工作到很晚，这时他将注意力转向了有关深水地平线漏油事件的最新消息。当“病态地盯着从海底管道中滚滚而出的石油”时，舒尔茨内心的某些东西突然崩溃了，使他对自己的职业道路产生了质疑。 “看看世界上的一切都是多么混乱，”舒尔茨——他是计算机科学博士二年级的学生。当时在哥伦比亚密苏里大学——回忆起当时的想法。 “我坐在这里，努力计算出这个复杂的形式演算，只是说一根线没有连接到另一根线，我在做什么？”

The question was still lingering in Schulz's mind when he attended an academic conference in 2012. One night over dinner, he posed an earnest question to a dozen or so professors and newly minted Ph.D.s from a top program in his field:"What makes you decide to get up and do what you do every day?"The whole table fell silent for at least 5 seconds, he says, before a junior scientist piped up to say that basic research can lead to important discoveries. After that, the conversation moved on to other topics."Oh my God,"Schulz recalls thinking."No one else knows why they're doing this. It's not just me."  

2012 年，当舒尔茨参加一次学术会议时，这个问题仍然萦绕在他的脑海中。一天晚上，在晚餐时，他向十几位教授和来自他所在领域的顶尖项目的新博士提出了一个严肃的问题：“是什么让你决定起床做你每天都会做的事情吗？”他说，全桌静默了至少 5 秒钟，然后一位初级科学家大声说基础研究可以带来重要发现。之后，谈话转向其他话题。“天哪，”舒尔茨回忆道，“没有人知道他们为什么要这样做。不仅仅是我。”

Going into grad school, he'd thought,"I'll go live the life of the mind. And I'll think deep, creative thoughts about really interesting, relevant problems."But the reality he found was different."I felt so knocked down into smaller and smaller and smaller corners and subdomains; … it was really demoralizing."  

进入研究生院时，他曾想，“我会过上心灵的生活。我会对真正有趣、相关的问题进行深入的、创造性的思考。”但他发现的现实是不同的。“我觉得就这样被打入越来越小的角落和子领域；……这真的让人士气低落。”

So, 2 months after his conference experience—still not able to shake the feeling that he wasn't doing something impactful—he walked into his adviser's office and announced that he was quitting his Ph.D. His adviser, whom he'd enjoyed working with, was supportive of his decision and asked Schulz what he planned to do next."I don't know—I just, I have to do something different," he recalls responding.  

因此，在他参加会议两个月后——仍然无法摆脱自己没有做一些有影响力的事情的感觉——他走进顾问的办公室，宣布他将辞去博士学位。他很高兴与他的顾问一起工作，他支持他的决定，并询问舒尔茨下一步打算做什么。“我不知道——我只是，我必须做一些不同的事情，”他回忆道。

Roughly a quarter of U.S. science and engineering Ph.D. students leave their graduate program within the first 3 years, according to [data](https://cgsnet.org/phd-completion-project) published by the Council of Graduate Schools. To some, that number is alarming—a problem to be solved. And in some cases, it may be—for example, if it's due to harassment, discrimination, financial hardship, or other factors unrelated to personal or professional goals.  

大约四分之一的美国科学与工程博士。根据研究生院理事会公布的数据，学生会在头三年内退出研究生课程。对于一些人来说，这个数字令人震惊——这是一个需要解决的问题。在某些情况下，可能是这样的——例如，如果这是由于骚扰、歧视、经济困难或与个人或职业目标无关的其他因素造成的。

But for individual students like Schulz, dropping out is sometimes a better course of action than continuing to grind away at a program that isn't fulfilling or that no longer furthers the student's long-term goals. These are the common themes that came up when _Science_ Careers interviewed nine people who left their Ph.D. programs without a doctorate.  

但对于像舒尔茨这样的学生个人来说，退学有时是比继续苦苦钻研无法实现学生的长期目标的课程更好的选择。这些是《科学职业》杂志采访九位博士毕业生时出现的共同主题。没有博士学位的项目。

## Lost interest in research  

对研究失去兴趣

Nearly everyone said the motivation that propelled them into grad school had dissipated by the time they made the decision to leave their program. "I was not totally present; I was mentally half checked out," said one former student when describing his final year of grad school. "Ultimately, I realized I didn't love scientific research as much as everyone else," said another.  

几乎每个人都表示，当他们决定退出项目时，推动他们进入研究生院的动力已经消失。 “我并没有完全在场；我的精神已经半衰弱了，”一位前学生在描述他研究生院的最后一年时说道。 “最终，我意识到我并不像其他人那样热爱科学研究，”另一位说。

For many, it wasn't that they lost interest in the subject, but that they found the day-to-day activities of research unfulfilling. That was the case for Ellen Martinsek, a former physics Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago in Illinois who left her program with a master's degree after 2 years. "Big picture, I was really excited about the project I was on; I was excited about pushing our knowledge a little bit further," Martinsek says. "But on a daily basis, I was staring at a computer screen analyzing videos, like all the time, in a sub-basement, which ended up not being a good fit for me at all." That disconnect helped her realize it was important that she enjoy the daily tasks and responsibilities of her work, whatever it is—something she hadn't previously prioritized when thinking about what she wanted in a career.  

对于许多人来说，并不是他们对这个学科失去了兴趣，而是他们发现日常研究活动没有成就感。前物理学博士艾伦·马丁塞克（Ellen Martinsek）就是这种情况。伊利诺伊州芝加哥大学的一名学生，两年后获得硕士学位。 “从大局来看，我对我正在进行的项目感到非常兴奋；我很高兴能进一步推动我们的知识，”马丁塞克说。 “但每天，我都在地下室里盯着电脑屏幕分析视频，就像一直以来一样，这最终根本不适合我。”这种脱节帮助她认识到，享受工作中的日常任务和责任是很重要的，无论是什么——这是她之前在考虑自己想要的职业生涯时并没有优先考虑的事情。

Part of her grad school responsibilities that she did enjoy was acting as a teaching assistant, which helped pave the way to becoming a high school physics teacher in Chicago—a job she loves. "Every single day is different," she says. "It's great."  

她确实喜欢在研究生院承担的部分职责是担任助教，这为她成为芝加哥高中物理教师铺平了道路——这是她热爱的工作。 “每一天都是不同的，”她说。 “这很棒。”

But for students who are further along, it can be harder to let go. "I was out of steam by year five," says Mario Muredda, who enrolled in a biochemistry Ph.D. program at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada, in 1998. He'd spent his first year "basically showing that the mouse we thought was transgenic wasn't. … It was a rough start." Then, his second project was quite different from what everyone else in the lab was working on, which left him feeling like the odd man out. Those two things took the wind out of his sails, diminishing his curiosity for research, he says.  

但对于已经走得更远的学生来说，放手可能会更困难。 “到了第五年，我就失去了动力，”攻读生物化学博士学位的马里奥·穆雷达 (Mario Muredda) 说。 1998 年，他在加拿大金斯顿女王大学完成了一个项目。他在第一年的学习“基本上证明了我们认为是转基因的老鼠并不是……这是一个艰难的开始。”然后，他的第二个项目与实验室其他人正在做的项目有很大不同，这让他感觉自己像个奇怪的人。他说，这两件事让他失去了动力，削弱了他对研究的好奇心。

But Muredda kept plugging away thinking, "You got to get the degree; you got to get the degree." Part of his motivation stemmed from his upbringing as a first-generation Canadian, in an Italian-Canadian family that values education. He didn't want to let his parents down. His program also didn't offer the option of leaving with a master's degree, although he's not sure he would've taken that route—had it been available—anyway.  

但穆雷达一直在埋头思考，“你必须获得学位；你必须获得学位。”他的部分动机源于他作为第一代加拿大人的成长经历，成长于一个重视教育的意大利裔加拿大家庭。他不想让父母失望。他的项目也没有提供获得硕士学位的选择，尽管他不确定自己是否会走这条路——如果有的话——无论如何。

So he carried on, and eventually made enough headway that his adviser told him he was ready to write up his findings. But Muredda's heart wasn't in it, he says.  

于是他继续前进，最终取得了足够的进展，他的顾问告诉他，他已经准备好写下他的发现。但穆雷达的心不在于此，他说。

He decided to stay enrolled in grad school but leave the lab and start a nonacademic job in health care communications, working to write up his dissertation in his spare time. But, he says, "as you can imagine, your passion doesn't come back after you leave the lab; it gets worse."It took a year before he was able to admit to himself that he wasn't going to finish, and he officially dropped out. After 8 years, "I left with nothing," he says.  

他决定继续读研究生，但离开实验室，开始从事医疗保健传播方面的非学术工作，在业余时间写论文。但是，他说，“正如你可以想象的那样，你离开实验室后你的热情就不会回来；情况会变得更糟。”他花了一年的时间才向自己承认他不会完成，他正式退学。八年后，“我一无所有，”他说。

The decision was crushing and emotionally scarring at the time. But with time everything gets better, he adds. Looking back, Muredda—who today is the chief executive officer of Harrison and Star, a health care communications agency in New York City—now sees it as the best thing that ever happened to him. "I wouldn't change it for anything,"he says of his decision to quit."I don't think I could be happier. … It sounds corny when people say that every challenge is an opportunity, but that is a big life lesson for me."  

这个决定在当时是令人震惊的，并且在情感上造成了创伤。但随着时间的推移，一切都会变得更好，他补充道。如今，穆雷达（Muredda）担任纽约市一家医疗保健通讯机构哈里森与斯塔（Harrison and Star）的首席执行官，回顾过去，他认为这是他一生中发生过的最好的事情。 “我不会做出任何改变，”他在谈到自己的辞职决定时说道，“我认为我不会比现在更快乐了……当人们说每一个挑战都是一个机会时，这听起来很老套，但这就是一个伟大的生活。”给我上一课。”

## Pursue a different passion  

追求不一样的热情

For Toby Hendy, the decision to quit her Ph.D. wasn't about disliking her research. It was more about what she'd rather be doing with her time: communicating science.  

对于托比·亨迪（Toby Hendy）来说，放弃博士学位的决定。并不是不喜欢她的研究。更多的是她更愿意用自己的时间做的事情：传播科学。

Hendy, who until January was a physics Ph.D. student at Australian National University, had gone to grad school because she wanted to follow a career path that involved teaching at a university. At the same time, she made educational videos about physics and math whenever she had free time outside the lab and posted them on her YouTube channel—something she had been doing since she was in high school. As her online following grew—she now has more than 200,000 subscribers—she realized that maybe the traditional university teaching route wasn't actually the best option for her."If teaching is what I want to do, I can actually reach a lot more people on YouTube than I ever could in a conventional classroom," she says.  

亨迪在一月份之前还是一名物理学博士。澳大利亚国立大学的学生，她读研究生是因为她想走一条在大学教书的职业道路。与此同时，只要实验室外有空闲时间，她就会制作有关物理和数学的教育视频，并将其发布到她的 YouTube 频道上——这是她从高中起就一直在做的事情。随着她的在线追随者不断增长——她现在拥有超过 200,000 名订阅者——她意识到也许传统的大学教学路线实际上并不是她的最佳选择。“如果教学是我想做的事情，我实际上可以接触到更多东西YouTube 上的人比我在传统教室里的人多，”她说。

So she quit her Ph.D. after 1 year in the program—posting a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Heip-2jYQ) online describing her decision—and turned her full focus to her budding YouTube channel, working from Queensland, Australia. She hasn't closed the door on maybe going back and getting a Ph.D. someday, but for now she wants to prioritize working as a science communicator."YouTube can be a place that people learn and get inspiration … so I feel like I'm part of something that's quite powerful."  

于是她放弃了博士学位。在参与该计划一年后，她在网上发布了一段视频来描述她的决定，并将全部注意力转向她在澳大利亚昆士兰州工作的新兴 YouTube 频道。她还没有关闭回国攻读博士学位的大门。有一天，但现在她想优先从事科学传播者的工作。“YouTube 可以成为人们学习和获得灵感的地方……所以我觉得我是一个非常强大的事物的一部分。”

Dissatisfaction with a Ph.D. program can also lead to the discovery of new passions, as former neuroscience student Luke Mitchell discovered. In 2016, 3 years into his Ph.D. at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mitchell had grown weary of the day-to-day reality of benchwork and started to look for something else that would satisfy his "geeky" passions. "I'd always been a really huge sci-fi and fantasy geek,"Mitchell says. He started to channel that passion into writing, spending evenings and weekends crafting his own science-fiction stories."I just kind of got more and more into that,"he says."As I was sitting there in lab, … all I wanted to do was get home and keep writing."  

对博士学位的不满正如前神经科学学生卢克·米切尔（Luke Mitchell）所发现的那样，该计划还可以导致新激情的发现。 2016年，他获得博士学位已经3年了。在宾夕法尼亚州费城的德雷克塞尔大学，米切尔已经厌倦了日常工作的现实，并开始寻找其他东西来满足他的“极客”热情。 “我一直是一个非常大的科幻和奇幻极客，”米切尔说。他开始将这种热情投入到写作中，利用晚上和周末创作自己的科幻故事。“我对此越来越感兴趣，”他说。“当我坐在实验室里时，……我想要的一切要做的就是回家继续写作。”

Mitchell's wife was also finishing medical school at the time and preparing to start a residency in Boston—about 500 km from Philadelphia, where Mitchell would have to stay if he were to continue with his Ph.D. Ultimately, he decided that he'd rather switch careers, move to Boston, and avoid a long-distance relationship. "I was already kind of having this affair with writing," he says, so it felt like the right time to move on.  

米切尔的妻子当时也刚刚完成医学院学业，准备前往距离费城约 500 公里的波士顿进行住院实习，如果米切尔想继续攻读博士学位，他就必须留在波士顿。最终，他决定宁愿转换职业，搬到波士顿，并避免异地恋。 “我已经对写作产生了兴趣，”他说，所以感觉现在是继续前进的最佳时机。

He left with a master's degree and started writing novels full time."I definitely feel like this is the thing that I don't want to stop doing."  

他获得了硕士学位并开始全职写小说。“我绝对觉得这是我不想停止做的事情。”

## Disheartened by academia  

对学术界感到沮丧

Some former students said that they became disinterested in an academic career—and in obtaining a Ph.D.—after experiencing the people culture. "I saw a lot of profoundly stressed and unhappy people in academia—and they were the ones who were succeeding," Schulz says. That made him think, "If that's success, then maybe I don't want to succeed at this."  

一些以前的学生表示，在体验了当地人的文化后，他们对学术生涯以及获得博士学位不再感兴趣。 “我在学术界看到了很多压力很大且不快乐的人，而他们却是成功的人，”舒尔茨说。这让他想，“如果这就是成功，那么也许我不想在这方面取得成功。”

Others looked ahead at the academic career path and decided that it wasn't for them."I think my idea of what an academic career really was wasn't exactly on target," says Andrew Racz, who started a Ph.D. in the earth science program at the University of California (UC), Santa Cruz, in 2007. After he was in grad school for a few years and his "eyes were opened to the true nitty-gritty of the research component," he realized that he wasn't interested in a professorship."If I could go back and really explain to my 25-year-old self what research faculty do, then maybe I would have decided earlier on that the master's is probably the right track for me."  

其他人展望了学术职业道路，并认为它不适合他们。 2007 年，他在加州大学圣克鲁斯分校 (UC) 的地球科学项目中获得博士学位。在读了几年研究生后，他“看到了研究部分的真正本质”，他意识到他对教授职位不感兴趣。“如果我能回去真正向 25 岁的自己解释研究人员的工作，那么也许我会更早地决定硕士学位可能是适合我的道路”。

Racz also realized that the idea of finishing graduate school just to spend "a couple more years of being sort of in the same position, albeit with hopefully a little bit of a higher paycheck, … just wasn't something that I was mentally prepared for."At the same time, Racz felt at home in Santa Cruz and had started a relationship with the man who's currently his partner, which made him want to stay put and not have to move for a postdoc or a faculty position.  

拉兹还意识到，完成研究生学业只是为了“在同样的职位上多呆几年，尽管希望薪水能高一点……”这并不是我心理上做好的准备。 “与此同时，拉兹在圣克鲁斯感到宾至如归，并与他目前的伴侣建立了关系，这让他想留在原地，而不必为了博士后或教职而搬家。

So, he left graduate school with a master's degree after 7 years and got a job as an associate engineer at the Marina Coast Water District."I still am in Santa Cruz; we just bought a house together,"Racz says."So, it kind of worked out like a happy ending."  

于是，7年后，他从研究生院毕业，获得了硕士学位，并在滨海海岸水区找到了一份副工程师的工作。“我还在圣克鲁斯；我们刚刚一起买了房子，”拉茨说。“所以，这有点像一个幸福的结局。”

For Lynne Tye, a former neuroscience Ph.D. student at UC San Francisco, academia felt like "the family business"—her mother, father, and older sister are all professors. Tye wanted to be a professor too. "When I was in college, I was super hyper-focused on doing all the things you need to do to get into a good grad school, a good Ph.D. program."  

琳恩·泰伊 (Lynne Tye) 曾是一名神经科学博士。作为加州大学旧金山分校的学生，学术界就像“家族企业”——她的母亲、父亲和姐姐都是教授。泰伊也想成为一名教授。 “当我上大学时，我非常专注于做所有你需要做的事情，以进入一所好的研究生院，一个好的博士项目。”

At first, things seemed to be going well. She passed her qualifying exam and co-authored and published a paper. But in her second year, Tye began crying on a regular basis. "I really honestly just wasn't sure what it was for many months. I wasn't sure if I was homesick—or if I didn't like my project or my lab. I didn't know if I should break up with my boyfriend or move in with him."  

起初，事情似乎进展顺利。她通过了资格考试并与人合着并发表了一篇论文。但到了第二年，泰伊开始经常哭泣。 “老实说，我好几个月都不确定这是什么。我不确定我是否想家，或者我是否不喜欢我的项目或我的实验室。我不知道我是否应该与我的男朋友，或者搬去和他一起住。”

Her "eureka moment" came when she sat, completely disinterested, in the audience for a postdoc's seminar—which made her realize that she was bored with research."It was confusing to think that the thing I was doing relatively well at was the cause of my unhappiness,"she says."It just kind of hit me all at once that I didn't love the path I was on and wanted out." Within a week she quit her Ph.D., deciding that she didn't want to spend decades doing research and climbing academia's "very linear ladder." Instead, she went into software development and now runs Key Values, a San Francisco-based engineering staffing website that she founded in 2017. "I still think neuroscience is … fascinating," she says. "The career path itself just wasn't for me."  

当她完全不感兴趣地坐在博士后研讨会的观众席上时，她的“尤里卡时刻”到来了——这让她意识到自己对研究感到厌倦。 “我突然意识到，我不喜欢我现在走的路，我想离开。”一周之内，她放弃了博士学位，决定不想花几十年的时间进行研究并攀登学术界“非常线性的阶梯”。相反，她进入了软件开发领域，现在运营着 Key Values，这是她于 2017 年创立的一家位于旧金山的工程人员招聘网站。“我仍然认为神经科学……令人着迷，”她说。 “职业道路本身并不适合我。”

## Looking back 回头看

After leaving their Ph.D. programs, many former students said that they felt like a failure. "That's part of what made it difficult,"Martinsek says. With so few women in physics, she had an added layer of emotion because she worried that she'd let her gender down. It helped when Martinsek reminded herself that her decision to leave "doesn't mean that I couldn't be successful—it doesn't mean that women in general can't be successful—but I'm making a choice for myself,"she says. It also helped that she was happy"pretty rapidly"afterward."But it was still hard at the time because you go into a program expecting to finish."  

离开博士学位后。许多以前的学生表示，他们感觉自己很失败。 “这就是造成困难的部分原因，”马丁塞克说。由于物理学领域的女性如此之少，她的情绪又增加了一层，因为她担心自己会让自己的性别失望。当马丁塞克提醒自己，她离开的决定“并不意味着我不能成功——并不意味着一般女性不能成功——但我正在为自己做出选择时，这很有帮助。”她说。这也有助于她事后“很快”感到高兴。“但当时仍然很困难，因为你进入一个计划并期望完成。”

Schulz recalls thinking, "Everyone thinks I'm stupid."He also fretted that because he'd spent years working on a specialized project in grad school, he didn't know what to put on his resume to go look for"a regular job."Potential employers, he thought, would view him as someone who didn't have any real experience. "How do I go out into the world at large? What do I even do with myself?" he wondered.  

舒尔茨回忆说，他当时想：“每个人都认为我很愚蠢。”他还担心，因为他在研究生院花了数年时间从事一个专门项目，所以他不知道在简历上写什么来寻找“一个常规的人”。他认为，潜在的雇主会认为他没有任何实际经验。 “我该如何走出去进入这个世界？我自己该怎么办？”他想知道。

He ended up taking a winding path—first working as a teacher and then moving into a career in software. "I think it worked out for the best," says Schulz, who now works as a quantitative software engineer at a mortgage company in Columbia, Missouri. "But that doesn't mean that I don't feel a lot of weird, complicated, sad feelings about it."  

他最终走上了一条曲折的道路——先是一名教师，然后进入软件行业。 “我认为这是最好的结果，”舒尔茨说，他现在在密苏里州哥伦比亚市的一家抵押贷款公司担任定量软件工程师。 “但这并不意味着我对此没有感到很多奇怪、复杂、悲伤的感觉。”

Tye says that quitting her Ph.D. was, in a lot of ways, the most difficult thing she's ever done—but also the thing she's most proud of. "It was so liberating," she says. "I was high on life." She likens the experience to the movie _The Truman Show_: "You realize that there's more than this little world."  

泰伊说，放弃她的博士学位。从很多方面来说，这是她做过的最困难的事情，但也是她最自豪的事情。 “这真是一种解放，”她说。 “我对生活充满热情。”她将这种经历比作电影《杜鲁门的世界》：“你会意识到，世界上不仅仅有这个小世界。”

Muredda, with the benefit of hindsight, has taken the time to reevaluate his motivation for entering grad school in the first place. "I went into science, I think, partly for the right reasons and partly for the wrong reasons." He was fascinated by the biology of life and was curious about how things work. But "for whatever reason, those three letters meant a lot to me," he says—referring to the Ph.D. "That's not the reason to go into science."  

事后看来，穆雷达已经花时间重新评估了他进入研究生院的动机。 “我认为，我进入科学领域，部分是出于正确的原因，部分是出于错误的原因。”他对生命的生物学着迷，并对事物的运作方式感到好奇。但“无论出于什么原因，这三个字母对我来说意义重大，”他说——指的是博士学位。 “这不是进入科学领域的原因。”
