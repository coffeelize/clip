This is a theory that’s previously been stated in [log/39-normie-hypothesis.gmi](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/39-normie-hypothesis.gmi), but I think it’s worth expanding on as it’s become very relevant with the recent Reddit shit-show actualizing just how bad that website has gotten along with social media in general.  

这是一个之前在 log/39-normie-hypothesis.gmi 中阐述过的理论，但我认为它值得扩展，因为它与最近的 Reddit 狗屎节目非常相关，人们意识到该网站与社交媒体的相处有多么糟糕。

I think the model demonstrate how the ’enshittification’ process is an inevitability with any social media that is run on a venture capital model.  

我认为这个模型展示了“enshittification”过程对于任何在风险投资模型上运行的社交媒体来说都是不可避免的。

An online community can be like a village, where you have familiar faces, collective experiences, shared values and so forth. It can be like a village and be five people, it can be like a village and be a thousand people.  

在线社区就像一个村庄，那里有熟悉的面孔、集体经历、共同的价值观等等。它可以像一个村庄，有五个人，也可以像一个村庄，有一千个人。

In this context, the defining trait of a village is that it’s group of people where the average interaction over time is with people you’ve seen before.  

在这种情况下，村庄的决定性特征是，它是一群人，随着时间的推移，他们的平均互动是与你以前见过的人。

A village is a precious thing. Many people go online to find a sense of belonging and community, and in the right circumstances, they can find it while they may struggle to do so offline. This is one of the great things about the Internet. It’s so large that no matter how weird and unconventional you are, there’s always more people just like you.  

一个村庄是一个宝贵的东西。许多人上网寻找归属感和社区感，在适当的情况下，他们可以找到它，而在线下可能很难找到。这是互联网的伟大之处之一。它是如此之大，以至于无论你多么古怪和非传统，总会有更多像你一样的人。

Because they are precious, it’s important to understand what makes a village a village, and what kills the village.  

因为它们很珍贵，所以了解是什么使一个村庄成为村庄，以及什么杀死了这个村庄非常重要。

The central thesis is that what these villages can’t tolerate is a sustained large influx of strangers. A stranger in this context is an nothing more or less than an unfamiliar face. I know it tends to draw the mind in those directions, but please refrain from projecting concepts such as nationality or ethnicity on the term. We’re all simultaneously villagers and strangers in various social circumstances.  

中心论点是，这些村庄不能容忍的是陌生人持续大量涌入。在这种情况下，陌生人只不过是一张陌生的面孔。我知道它往往会将人们的注意力吸引到这些方向上，但请不要在该术语上投射诸如国籍或种族之类的概念。在不同的社会环境中，我们既是村民，又是陌生人。

A slow trickle of strangers is tolerable, a brief large influx is fine; the strangers’ average interaction is eventually stabilizes and biases toward the a stable group of members, and they quickly find shared values and become villagers too. They become familiar faces, and undoubtedly make their mark on the shared culture. That’s often a refreshing and welcome thing. It’s still a village.  

少量的陌生人是可以忍受的，短暂的大量涌入也没什么问题。陌生人的平均互动最终趋于稳定，并偏向稳定的成员群体，他们很快就找到了共同的价值观，也成为了村民。他们成为熟悉的面孔，无疑在共同的文化中留下了自己的印记。这通常是一件令人耳目一新且受欢迎的事情。它仍然是一个村庄。

When sustained growth is too large, the strangers’ average interaction is with other strangers, and even if this would have eventually stabilized into something like a village, there are yet more strangers to prevent this from happening. Everyone stays strangers, and a sort of stranger-culture emerges where guards are up by default because there are never any familiar faces.  

当持续增长太大时，陌生人的平均互动是与其他陌生人的互动，即使这最终会稳定成一个村庄之类的东西，也会有更多的陌生人来阻止这种情况的发生。每个人都保持着陌生人的状态，一种陌生人文化出现了，因为那里从来没有熟悉的面孔，所以默认情况下都有警卫。

It’s no longer a village, but something like a train station. The default mode of being is _passing through_. People come and go, and there’s no real sense of belonging. There is a sense of anonymity, there are no lasting repercussions for cutting in line or being rude.  

这里不再是一个村庄，而是一个类似火车站的地方。默认的存在模式是穿越。人来人往，没有真正的归属感。有一种匿名感，插队或粗鲁不会产生持久的影响。

It’s an oppressive, alienating, and disempowering environment.  

这是一个压抑、疏远和剥夺权力的环境。

You’re _in_ a train station, you’re not part of it. There’s nothing you can do to improve it. Values are replaced by laws. Laws are enforced through a rigid structure of guards and uniforms, and the particularities and nuances of the situation don’t matter. If someone is subjectively being a jerk, you can’t really do anything about it. You just have to put up with it.  

你在火车站，但你不是其中的一部分。你无能为力来改进它。价值观被法律取代。法律是通过严格的警卫和制服结构来执行的，情况的特殊性和细微差别并不重要。如果某人主观上是个混蛋，你对此无能为力。你只需要忍受它。

Now consider running a social media site like a start-up, with quarterly growth targets, with investors to impress and eyes on an eventual IPO.  

现在考虑像初创公司一样运营一个社交媒体网站，设定季度增长目标，让投资者留下深刻印象并着眼于最终的首次公开募股。

If you want to absolutely destroy a website that is all about building communities and meeting new people, then aim for the site and all communities to always be growing as much as possible. Make that a design goal of the site. Pump those subscriber numbers up.  

如果您想彻底摧毁一个致力于建立社区和结识新朋友的网站，那么就应该让该网站和所有社区始终尽可能地发展。将此作为网站的设计目标。增加这些订户数量。

What you’ll get is a place where everyone is a stranger, where being a jerk is the norm, where there is no sense of belonging, where civility and arguing in good faith is irrelevant because you’re not talking _to someone_, you’re performing in front of an audience to make the number next to your comment go up so you can briefly feel something that almost resembles belonging and shared values.  

你会得到一个地方，每个人都是陌生人，混蛋是常态，没有归属感，礼貌和善意的争论都是无关紧要的，因为你不是在和某人说话，你是在观众面前表演，让你的评论旁边的数字上升，这样你就能短暂地感受到一些几乎类似于归属感和共同价值观的东西。

Terminally online and starving for human connection, you’re left clinging on to this artificial sense of belonging like Harlow’s monkeys to their wire-mesh mothers. It will never be real, but it’s all you have.  

终末在线并渴望与人建立联系，你只能紧紧抓住这种人为的归属感，就像哈洛的猴子对它们的铁丝网母亲一样。它永远不会是真实的，但它是你所拥有的一切。

The only sense of belonging you can find is through tribalism, deep trenches are dug along the fault-lines of the most superficial differences because that’s all there is to see. Nuance requires lasting relationships. People aren’t really people, they’re reduced to an opinion you can’t tolerate, or a flavor of potato chips you can’t stand, a starter pokemon you think is lame.  

你能找到的唯一归属感是通过部落主义，沿着最表面差异的断层线挖出深沟，因为这就是你能看到的一切。细微差别需要持久的关系。人不是真正的人，他们被简化为你无法容忍的观点，或者你无法忍受的薯片味道，你认为是蹩脚的入门神奇宝贝。

Ironically, according to the model proposed earlier, the best thing that could happen to Reddit, in terms of the website not being shit from a community perspective, is that it stops growing, maybe even shrinks a bit. This will let communities stabilize and become more like villages again, and the site will be better for it.  

讽刺的是，根据之前提出的模型，从社区的角度来看，Reddit 网站可能发生的最好的事情就是它停止增长，甚至可能会缩小一点。这将使社区变得稳定并再次变得更像村庄，并且场地也会因此变得更好。

Of course this is a real predicament from business sense, with the looming IPO and all that. The only way to make money is to grow, and the only way to grow is to kill the community.  

当然，随着首次公开募股（IPO）迫在眉睫，从商业角度来看，这是一个真正的困境。赚钱的唯一方法就是发展，而发展的唯一方法就是消灭社区。
