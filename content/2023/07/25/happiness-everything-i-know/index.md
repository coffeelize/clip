Happiness is an emotional state of no anxiety and fear. A feeling of satisfaction that what I am doing now is what I want to be doing.  

幸福是一种没有焦虑和恐惧的情绪状态。一种满足感，因为我现在正在做的事情就是我想做的事情。

[Mindfulness](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/mindfulness/) is the best tool I have in staying happy no matter what the circumstance is. Life is suffering and it's best to acknowledge that. In that you cannot avoid pain and hurt. Even if you try hard. You will get hurt. You will mess up and you will feel regret. It is logical then to accept these feelings as they are. No matter how bad they may feel in the moment. The key to happiness is detachment. The ability to mindfully observe the feelings and thoughts you have and _choose_ what you think is the right thing to do in the moment. The thoughts you have and feelings you feel are your body's reaction to the environment it is in.  

无论情况如何，正念是我保持快乐的最佳工具。生活是痛苦的，最好承认这一点。因为你无法避免痛苦和伤害。即使你很努力。你会受伤。你会搞砸，你会感到后悔。那么接受这些感受的本来面目是合乎逻辑的。无论他们此刻感觉有多糟糕。幸福的关键是超然。能够用心观察你的感受和想法，并选择你认为当下正确的事情。您的想法和感受是您的身体对其所处环境的反应。

Ignoring the thoughts and feelings you have is not good as it doesn't solve the problem. Only delays it and makes it worse. The thoughts and feelings will still be there. It is instead best to mindfully observe what it is you feel. Ask yourself why you feel this way? If you detach yourself from this situation and look at it from a different perspective, you will often find the reason why you feel this way. Is there anything you can do to avoid feeling like this in the future? Sometimes the sad answer is that, no you can't. The feeling may always be there due to disease or trauma. What you do have the power to change, no matter what situation life throws you in, is mindset. A change of perspective is all you need to be happy. It is your choice to be happy. Happiness is not a reaction to the environment you are in. It is a state of mind. The awareness that the negative thoughts you think about have no power over you. Because you can choose to ignore them as they bring no value to your life. The pain you feel has no power over you because it is temporary. It will go away. And you have the choice to avoid it. Controlling emotions and feelings will never work because these feelings are natural. Mindfulness and awareness is the only thing you have complete control over.  

忽视你的想法和感受是不好的，因为它不能解决问题。只会拖延时间，让事情变得更糟。想法和感受仍然会存在。相反，最好用心观察你的感受。问问自己为什么会有这种感觉？如果你把自己从这种情况中抽离出来，从不同的角度来看待它，你常常会找到你有这种感觉的原因。您可以做些什么来避免将来有这样的感觉吗？有时悲伤的答案是，不，你不能。由于疾病或创伤，这种感觉可能一直存在。无论生活将你置于何种境地，你有能力改变的是心态。改变观点就足以让你快乐。幸福是你的选择。幸福不是对所处环境的反应，而是一种心态。意识到你所想到的消极想法对你没有任何影响力。因为你可以选择忽略它们，因为它们对你的生活没有任何价值。你感受到的痛苦对你没有任何影响力，因为它是暂时的。它会消失。并且您可以选择避免它。控制情绪和感觉永远不会起作用，因为这些感觉是自然的。正念和意识是你唯一可以完全控制的事情。

Aside from mindfulness and awareness, you can increase your chances of feeling happy by focusing on these three things:  

除了正念和意识之外，您还可以通过关注以下三件事来增加感到快乐的机会：

1.  Proper [diet](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/health/nutrition/) 适当的饮食
2.  [Exercise 锻炼](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/fitness/)
3.  Consistent [sleep](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sleep/) 持续的睡眠

These 3 things I found to most greatly improve anything else that I want to do in life. A healthy body leads to a healthy mind.  

我发现这三件事可以极大地改善我生活中想做的其他事情。健康的身体带来健康的心灵。

Another point not mentioned there is _purpose_. A lack of direction in life and the constant questioning of whether what you are doing is the 'right' thing only causes more and more anxiety with time. I find [stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) philosophy solves this problem for me. There is no purpose to life. There is nothing in life you ought to be doing. Nothing in life you have to prove to anyone. You make your own purpose and meaning in life. I find this philosophy incredibly liberating as there is no right or wrong answer to the question of what it is you should be doing in life. If you are unhappy with what you are doing, try to change it. Don't attach yourself to anything as nothing is permanent. Value the things you have in life now. Only you can give meaning to anything. Choose wisely what matters to you and focus on that.  

还有一点没有提到的是目的。随着时间的推移，缺乏生活方向以及不断质疑自己所做的事情是否“正确”只会导致越来越多的焦虑。我发现坚忍哲学为我解决了这个问题。生活没有目的。生活中没有什么是你应该做的。生活中没有什么是你必须向任何人证明的。您制定自己的人生目标和意义。我发现这种哲学令人难以置信地解放，因为对于“你在生活中应该做什么”这个问题没有正确或错误的答案。如果你对自己所做的事情不满意，请尝试改变它。不要执着于任何事物，因为没有什么是永恒的。珍惜你现在生活中拥有的东西。只有你才能赋予任何事物意义。明智地选择对你来说重要的事情并专注于它。

## My personal happiness [](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/life/happiness#my-personal-happiness) 我个人的幸福

For me personally, I try to be very methodical with what makes me happy and what I value the most in life. I wrote down some [rules](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/rules) that I try my best to follow. Each of these rules came from my own experiences and failures in life. Learning from mistakes. Learning. And never looking back. I wrote these rules because I often have to remind myself of these simple things in life. Don't compare myself to other people. Be mindful. Be honest. And above all, [focus](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/). Focus on things that matter to me. Disregard the rest.  

就我个人而言，我尝试非常有条理地对待让我快乐的事情以及我生活中最看重的事情。我写下了一些我尽力遵守的规则。这些规则中的每一条都来自我自己的经历和生活中的失败。从错误中学习。学习。并且永不回头。我写这些规则是因为我经常需要提醒自己生活中的这些简单的事情。不要将自己与其他人进行比较。铭记。说实话。最重要的是，专注。专注于对我来说重要的事情。忽略其余的。

Writing it all down is helpful. But what matters is going through and being mindful enough to follow through with these rules I wrote down for myself. Being mindful of my body and thoughts and not attaching myself to needless things.  

将其全部写下来很有帮助。但重要的是要经历并足够注意地遵循我为自己写下的这些规则。正念自己的身体和思想，不执着于不必要的事情。

One other thing I found helped me the most in life. Is expressing myself. Expressing my thoughts, feelings and frustrations. Be it through music, writing, drawing or code. I never want to hold back what I feel. I embrace it. I also find great joy in self improvement and honing [my workflow](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/my-workflow). It is an endless pursuit with no end goal in sight and that brings me happiness. Because no matter what happens in life. I can strive to improve myself. Be a better person than I was before.  

我发现另一件事对我的生活帮助最大。正在表达我自己。表达我的想法、感受和挫折。无论是通过音乐、写作、绘画还是代码。我从来不想压抑自己的感受。我拥抱它。我还从自我提升和磨练工作流程中找到了巨大的乐趣。这是一种永无止境的追求，看不到最终目标，这给我带来了快乐。因为无论生活中发生什么。我可以努力提高自己。成为一个比以前更好的人。

I love to [live minimally](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/minimalism/) and only use what I need. Think about things that matter to me. Cutting out the noise and focusing on what's important to me. I love cutting out any kind of distractions from my life. I love not keeping everything in my head and letting software and tools do the things they are good at. Storing and retrieving information. Events, todos, tasks and projects.  

我喜欢简约的生活，只使用我需要的东西。想想对我来说重要的事情。排除噪音，专注于对我来说重要的事情。我喜欢排除生活中的任何干扰。我喜欢不把所有事情都记在脑子里，而是让软件和工具做它们擅长的事情。存储和检索信息。事件、待办事项、任务和项目。

I practice this art of minimizing and focusing on what's important to me & removing everything that is not every single day.  

我练习这种艺术，最大限度地减少并专注于对我来说重要的事情，并消除所有不是每天的事情。

I also try very hard to simply not have the things that I cannot change, affect me in any meaningful way. I focus on love (giving and receiving) and appreciation (being grateful for things I have now) over hate (arguing) and being annoyed by things (not being in the moment).  

我也非常努力地避免那些我无法改变的事情以任何有意义的方式影响我。我专注于爱（给予和接受）和欣赏（对我现在拥有的事物心存感激），而不是仇恨（争论）和对事物感到烦恼（不在当下）。

It's harder to be [truly happy in modern online society](https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1592212465747922945) as no one can go at their own pace and feel settled/good about it because there are too many avenues for comparison. There are too many people doing better, performing more, with more visibility.  

在现代网络社会中要真正快乐变得更加困难，因为没有人可以按照自己的节奏前进并感到安定/良好，因为有太多的比较途径。有太多人做得更好、表现更好、知名度更高。

Just because you're going at your own pace, don't be led to think you're"under performing".  

不要仅仅因为你按照自己的节奏前进，就认为你“表现不佳”。

[Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/) did a [nice episode on science behind happiness](https://hubermanlab.com/science-based-tools-for-increasing-happiness/). Loved the part about synthetic happiness.  

休伯曼做了一集关于幸福背后的科学的精彩剧集。喜欢关于合成幸福的部分。

One important thing I always keep in my mind is that everyone has their own unique idea of what happiness is. And I can't force my happiness onto anyone. If I truly care about a person, I always try to find what that happiness for the person is and try and give it to them.  

我始终铭记在心的一件重要事情是，每个人对于幸福是什么都有自己独特的看法。我不能把我的幸福强加给任何人。如果我真正关心一个人，我总是试图找到这个人的幸福是什么，并尝试将其给予他们。

## Other things that help [](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/life/happiness#other-things-that-help)  

其他有帮助的事情

-   Maintaining a social support network (and having a dog).  
    
    维持社会支持网络（并养狗）。
-   An hour of light to moderate cardio _every day_.  
    
    每天一小时轻度至中度有氧运动。
-   Focusing on hobbies. 专注于兴趣爱好。
-   Focusing on pragmatism and thoughtfulness in every action (or at least, aspiring to). Stoicism and virtue ethics.  
    
    在每一个行动中注重实用主义和深思熟虑（或者至少是渴望这样做）。斯多葛主义和美德伦理学。
-   Keep asking for help, trying new things. Someone somewhere has an answer for you. It also helps if you have someone in your life to serve as your “patient advocate”, keeping you honest, on track, to help calibrate your self reporting.  
    
    不断寻求帮助，尝试新事物。有人在某个地方为你提供了答案。如果您生活中有人充当您的“患者倡导者”，让您保持诚实、步入正轨，帮助校准您的自我报告，这也会有所帮助。
-   Sunlight. Get outside. Or take at least 4000 IU vitamin D.  
    
    阳光。到外面去。或者服用至少 4000 IU 维生素 D。
-   Predictable sleep patterns. Set an alarm both to wake up and go to sleep.  
    
    可预测的睡眠模式。设置闹钟以起床和入睡。
-   Let go of societies values and expectations. If you feel a pressure to be successful, let that go. Swallow your pride, stay away from the desire to fulfill other people's expectation of you (if you can).  
    
    放弃社会价值观和期望。如果你感到有成功的压力，那就放手吧。收起你的骄傲，远离满足别人对你的期望的欲望（如果可以的话）。
-   Help people around you. If you are a good musician, start a meetup group in a park and teach people how to play guitar. If you are good at coding, start a meetup group in the public library to teach people how to code. Limit your students to 2-3 and try to make a deep, positive impact in their lives.  
    
    帮助你周围的人。如果您是一位优秀的音乐家，可以在公园里组织一个聚会小组并教人们如何弹吉他。如果您擅长编码，可以在公共图书馆建立一个聚会小组，教人们如何编码。将学生人数限制在 2-3 人，并尝试对他们的生活产生深刻、积极的影响。
-   From my experience, practicing empathy and helping others around me helped a lot. Be aware though, don't fall into the trap of trying to measure success by quantity. Its better to help 2-3 people become great than to help 100 people get average skills.  
    
    根据我的经验，练习同理心并帮助周围的人有很大帮助。但请注意，不要陷入试图通过数量来衡量成功的陷阱。帮助 2-3 个人变得优秀比帮助 100 个人获得一般技能更好。

-   [I agree with you that happiness is peace. And it is a state of mind irregardless of what you experience, you can be in this peaceful state detached from emotions and feelings, only attaching yourself to things that matter to you. Mindfully observing your experience.  
    
    我同意你的观点，幸福就是平静。这是一种心态，无论你经历什么，你都可以处于这种平静的状态，脱离情绪和感受，只关注对你来说重要的事情。用心观察你的经历。](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8f52lr/my_thoughts_on_happiness/)
    -   As for its relation to neurochemistry, I most certainly agree that it plays a major role. That's why things like exercise, proper nutrition and plentiful sleep plays such a huge role in achieving and maintaining this state of happiness. Without those three things, or in other words, without you taking care of your body, reaching these states of being is simply much harder if not impossible.  
        
        至于它与神经化学的关系，我绝对同意它发挥着重要作用。这就是为什么锻炼、适当的营养和充足的睡眠等因素对于实现和维持这种幸福状态起着如此巨大的作用。如果没有这三件事，或者换句话说，如果你不照顾自己的身体，达到这些存在状态即使不是不可能，也会更加困难。
