Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT triggered a remarkable societal and computational shift that feels comparable to the impact from the initial internet era with its first impressive search engines like Google. LLMs are the toast of the town.  

ChatGPT 等大型语言模型 (LLM) 引发了显着的社会和计算转变，其影响堪比最初的互联网时代及其第一个令人印象深刻的搜索引擎（如 Google）的影响。法学硕士是全城的焦点。

Writing emails, reports, school homework, analysis, code, summaries. The list goes on.  

撰写电子邮件、报告、学校作业、分析、代码、摘要。这样的例子还在继续。

Save from when you would delegate this task to another fellow human, long hours would be passed in the past trying to conjure a piece of text that could communicate something to another entity. Now this can be made at scale, at low cost, with low effort.  

除非您将这项任务委托给另一个人类同胞，否则过去会花费很长时间试图变出一段可以与另一个实体传达某些内容的文本。现在，这可以以低成本、省力的方式大规模实现。

Since we are still liable for the results of this tool, i.e. it’s still our name on the email sender, instead of just sending that email, we might first read that LLM output, interpret it, understand it, and then send it.  

由于我们仍然对该工具的结果负责，即电子邮件发件人上的名字仍然是我们的名字，因此我们可能首先阅读 LLM 输出，解释它，理解它，然后发送它，而不仅仅是发送该电子邮件。

## [](https://lopespm.com/notes/2023/07/02/writing-as-a-form-of-thinking.html#more-than-just-text)More than just text 不仅仅是文字

Text is a form of communication. If something, or someone wrote it for us, certain decisions were made along the way to convey the goal that we gave. Out of the many paths possible to crystallize that piece of knowledge into a piece text, one of them was chosen.  

文本是一种交流形式。如果有什么东西，或者有人为我们写了它，那么我们就会在整个过程中做出某些决定来传达我们给出的目标。将知识结晶成一篇文本的多种可能途径中，我们选择了其中一条。

I would claim that something gets lost on that delegation.  

我想说，该代表团遗漏了一些东西。

The writing process is more than just the production of text. Many times it requires the exploration of different perspectives, thinking deeply and coming to terms that we don’t know enough about a subject and need to learn more about it.  

写作过程不仅仅是文本的产生。很多时候，它需要探索不同的视角，深入思考，并认识到我们对某个学科还不够了解，需要了解更多。

For example, it’s essential for me to have a notebook at hand to take notes during meetings and formal discussions. I write phrases, loose words, make small diagrams, jot down some reminders. Some of them are never to be re-read again, others I revisit to structure them down into a concise structure. Most of all, they help me think about a problem.  

例如，对我来说，在会议和正式讨论期间手头有一个笔记本来记笔记是很重要的。我写短语、松散的单词、制作小图表、记下一些提醒。其中一些永远不会再被重新阅读，另一些我会重新审视以将它们组织成简洁的结构。最重要的是，它们帮助我思考问题。

Same holds for notes and articles. I start with a cloud of loosely related ideas, which I attempt to refine into a structured form. Similar to the [double diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)) process.  

笔记和文章也是如此。我从一堆松散相关的想法开始，试图将其提炼成结构化的形式。类似于双金刚石工艺。

Same for books. Several times I’ve come to terms that I learned close to nothing about a book read one month before. Or conversations. Or movies. Or experiences.  

书籍也一样。有好几次，我承认自己对一个月前读过的一本书几乎一无所知。或者对话。或者电影。或者经历。

This is, [except](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otazg3TuPWM) if I reflected or acted about them. Except if I wrote down my conclusions about them.  

除非我对它们进行反思或采取行动。除非我写下我对它们的结论。

For me, taking notes helps make sure that I’m really thinking hard about what’s in there. If I disagree with the book, sometimes it takes a long time to read the books because I’m writing so much in the margin  

对我来说，做笔记有助于确保我真正认真思考其中的内容。如果我不同意这本书，有时需要花很长时间才能读完这本书，因为我在页边空白处写了太多内容
